# Git from Scratch

This repository contains the essentials of using [Git][credits-git] and contributing to GitHub projects. It's goal is to provide the principles, tools and commands required to empower developers to track, manage and propose changes; and to provide consistency across Git projects. By using it, developers should be able to create a new repo, commit changes the right way, review the commit logs, merge changes, send pull requests, and more.

### Credits ###

Git from Scratch was inspired by [CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript][credits-harvard-course] online course, which was mainly instructed by [Brian Yu][credits-harvard-instructor], and contains lectures and hands-on projects related to [Git][credits-git] and GitHub. It was also inspired by [Udacity's Version Control with Git][credits-udacity-course] online course, which was instructed by [Richard Kalehoff][credits-udacity-instructor]; by Olivine Labs' [Lua Style Guide][credits-lua-style], cocos2d's [cocos2d Javascript test and games][credits-cocos2d-games], and OneSignal's [Emoji Picker][credits-emoji-picker]. This version is focused on the basics of [Git][credits-git], and GitHub's project management.
